immerser will build heatmaps for language and general habit acquisition

Gameify your habits (especially language acquisition) by logging immersion time and viewing you daily heatmaps.

## Details

The psychology of heatmaps and learning streaks helps many people stay consistent when trying to build new habits.

- Create a new habit to instantiate a new heatmap
- Navigate to the daily to-do screen and check off completed habits to fill the heatmap
- When selecting immersion, allow the user to specify the immersion material
  - If this can somehow hook up to alexandria or the same APIs alexandria uses to populate media, that would be great
- Generate data dashboards for analyzing time-based habits (such as language acquisition immersion)
- Add a timer to aide in logging time-based habits
